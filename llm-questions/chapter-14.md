### Question 1
Since we always divide the number of possible numbers in half every time we ask 
a question, the minimum number of questions Q needed to be sure of the correct 
value is the amount where $\frac{1000}{2^Q} \leq 1$, meaning we have found the number Alice has guessed.
Since $log_2(1000) = 9.96$, this means we have to ask ten questions for our options to be restricted to one 
possible value.
