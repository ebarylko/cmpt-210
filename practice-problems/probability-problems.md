## Question 1 
Since there is an equal probability of buying any of the tickets, the probability of buying a ticket is equal 
to $\frac{1}{100}$.

Let $W$ be the event where we win after buying two tickets. 

Let $S$ be the set of all 100 lottery tickets.

Let $T_1$ be the event where the first ticket was the winning ticket, and $T_2$ the 
event where the second ticket was the winning ticket.

$W = T_1 \cup T_2$

$pr(W) = pr(T_1) + pr(T_2) - pr(T_1 \cap T_2)$

Since we can only have one winning ticket, we know that the events $T_1$ and $T_2$ are disjoint, implying that
$pr(T_1 \cap T_2) = 0$.

Since we have a uniform probability space, we know that $pr(W) = |W| * pr(T_1) = 2 * \frac{1}{100} = \frac{1}{50}$

The probability that you win is $\frac{1}{50}$.

Could I use exclusion inclusion theory or the properties of uniform probability spaces to solve this question?
