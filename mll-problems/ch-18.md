## Question one
Let $I_A$ and $I_B$ be the indicator variables for events A and B. Prove that $I_A$ and $I_B$
are independent iff A and B are independent.

Forward direction: prove $I_A, I_B$ independent $\rightarrow A, B$ independent

If $I_A$ and $I_B$ are independent, this means that $Pr(I_A = c \cap I_B = d) = Pr(I_A = c)Pr(I_B = d), c, d \in \set{0, 1}$

This implies that the probability that event $A$ occurs is independent of the probability that
event $B$ occurs.

We know that $Pr(I_A = 1) = Pr(A)$, and $Pr(I_A = 0) = Pr(A^{\complement})$

Similarly, $Pr(I_A = 1) = Pr(A)$, and $Pr(I_A = 0) = Pr(A^{\complement})$
